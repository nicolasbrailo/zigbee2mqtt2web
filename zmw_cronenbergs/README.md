# ZMWCronenbergs

Runs calendar-based automation tasks:

* Checks for lights left on in the morning, turns them off, and sends a Telegram notification if any were one. Use if you want to automatically turn off lights during the week day after people have left the house.
* Vacations mode: will randomly turn lights on and off in the late afternoon, the evining and then at night will shut every light off - to simulate as if people were wondering around the house.
* Speaker-announce: at scheduled times, will play an announcement through the speakers, every day. Useful to remind house-inhabitants of periodic tasks.
* Battery alerts: every week, it will check which devices have low battery, and send a Telegram reminder.
