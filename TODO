* When running restart_and_logs from a dir that's not the svc dir, it will look for logs.sh in cwd
* Audit UI styles
* Move baticasa_buttons out of generic zmw project
* Make dashboard load faster - load lights first, deferr other requests?
* Review all UI code for mqtt_heating, there's too much vibe
* dashboard svc -> How do I install authbind automatically
* all svcs -> Run tests as part of systemd service start?
* all svcs -> lint and check test coverage
* new svc Implement presence sensor to aggregate multiple PIRs, turn on/off lights in kitchen
* new svc mqtt_shelly_plugs new svc
* new svc Build notification service that decides to multiplex to WA or Telegram
* Move all door actions to doormon instead of contactmon?
* mqtt lights -> stream changes from mqtt to web socet to UI
* mqtt heating config -> rules can be simplified, the scheduled min temp is too complex. Instead, express it as a list of schedules (one per sensor and active time)
* mqtt_sensor_mon sensor GC is likely broken (or never worked?) Seems it only removes old samples
* mqtt_sensor_mon sensor db path is absolute, make it relative to run dir?
* baticasa_doorbell can be made generic, there is no custom logic there
* mqtt_doorbell -> audit usage of exceptions, there are many that can escape in reolink.py
* mqtt_speaker_announce Test mic record for announce service
* buttons service transition period isn't working for world off
* cronnenbergs: alert Olivia dientes y tarea
* cronnenbers: vacation mode
* telegram command to pause notifications
* telegram bot -> Have a timer to register commands, to give a few seconds to services who want to reg a new command to do it all at once (N services start, wait 5 seconds, then publish to Telegram the list of commands)
* telegram send msg on system error for any monitored service
* misc Look for lost z2m devices
* misc Look into journal rotation - why isn't it rotating on its own
* misc Can I join baticasa_doorbell with the main mqtt_doorbell service?
