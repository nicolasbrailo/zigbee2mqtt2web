* Rename build dir to www.artifacts so it's not in gitignore

* Temp sensors -> Apply "windchill" factor
* Monitor arbitrary svc with servicemon
* dashboard svc -> How do I install authbind automatically

* mqtt lights -> stream changes from mqtt to web socet to UI
* mqtt heating config -> rules can be simplified, the scheduled min temp is too complex. Instead, express it as a list of schedules (one per sensor and active time)
* mqtt_sensor_mon sensor GC is likely broken (or never worked?) Seems it only removes old samples
* mqtt_sensor_mon sensor db path is absolute, make it relative to run dir?

* telegram send msg on system error for any monitored service
* misc Look for lost z2m devices
* misc Look into journal rotation - why isn't it rotating on its own
* misc Can I join baticasa_doorbell with the main mqtt_doorbell service?
